1. Optical density conversion
2. Test GLM with short channels - examine betas
3. Clean up main scripts and add some comments in front
4. Make help on functions consistent
5. Move non-working/tested functions to new directory
6. Add documentation on main functionality
7. Add example dataset and functions to analyze it through first level
8. Robust regression option
9. AR-IRLS approach. Somewhat done. But, need to do all orders, filter regressions, then select best model order via BIC criterion.
