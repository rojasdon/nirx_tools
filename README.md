Toolbox for reading/writing/processing NIRx near infrared spectroscopy system data. 
Some inter-operability between nirx_toolbox and spm_fnirs and homer2 is also provided.
There may be issues that are system specific - the code has only been assessed on the CSU NIRx 
NIRScout Extended System with 48 emitters and 32 detectors.
